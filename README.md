## windows-funny-virus-noharm

I made a funny trol virus in C++ with the help of chat-gpt because I don't know how to use C++ or the windows API.

### How to use
To use this just download the 'installmeiamvirus.exe' on any windows 10/11 pc and run it. Depending on if you run it as admin or not it wil do diffrent things, non of theys things wil do any permenent harm but they are really anoying.
